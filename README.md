# Owen Howe - Personal Platform

A personal portfolio site with a brutalist editorial design system. Built with React 19, Framer Motion, and hand-crafted CSS. Deployed on Vercel.

## Architecture & Tech Stack

This project uses vanilla CSS over component libraries (Tailwind, Material UI, etc.) to achieve specific visual aesthetics — brutalist borders, editorial serif typography, parallax moodboard, and wooden bookshelf.

- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite 7
- **Routing**: React Router v7 (SPA, client-side navigation)
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode via React Context + CSS custom properties (`[data-theme="dark"]`)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (`src/index.css`) with CSS custom properties + inline React styles
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (`motion.div`, `useScroll`, `useTransform`, `useSpring`, `AnimatePresence`)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploys on push to `main`)

## Key Design Patterns

### Responsive Strategy (768px breakpoint)

All responsive behavior uses a single breakpoint (`768px`) with two mechanisms:

1. **CSS media queries** in `src/index.css` — layout, grid, moodboard positioning, nav visibility
2. **`useIsMobile()` hook** in React components — conditional rendering, inline style values, parallax ranges

| Component | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| **Navigation** | Inline links right-aligned, "Owen Howe" brand on home / "OH" on subpages, dark mode toggle far-right | Hamburger + dark mode toggle, auto-hides on scroll down, "OH" brand |
| **MoodBoard** | Typography overlay + 4 images, full parallax, `overflow: visible` | Images only (no text), stripped padding/borders, dampened parallax, `overflow: hidden` |
| **Library** | 6 books/shelf, `2rem` gaps, centered | Viewport-calculated books/shelf, `space-evenly`, full-bleed shelves |
| **Sycamore Card** | Full card with heading + subtext + CTA, offset left | Compact logo + CTA, offset right, overlaps moodboard bottom via negative margin |

### MoodBoard

The moodboard is a parallax image collage using absolute positioning. Four images (soccer, flora, food, cars) float with Framer Motion `useTransform` parallax. On desktop, large "Soccer. Tech. Food. Flora." typography overlays the images with `mix-blend-mode: difference`.

**Desktop**: Positions via CSS classes (`.mb-fashion`, `.mb-flora`, `.mb-food`, `.mb-cars`) with `clamp()` widths.

**Mobile**: CSS media query overrides strip `.bento-card` padding/borders for edge-to-edge images. Parallax ranges are reduced ~60% via conditional `useTransform`. Typography is hidden entirely (`{!isMobile && ...}`). Container uses `overflow: hidden` to clip cards within bounds.

**CSS class note**: `.mb-fashion` is a legacy class name — it now positions the soccer image. The class names map to grid positions, not content.

### Resume Career Cards

Experience cards use a rotating color scheme: `['var(--bg-color)', 'var(--mustard)', 'var(--terracotta)']`. Text colors are computed per-card for contrast (white on terracotta, dark on mustard/cream). The Sycamore Creek banner uses teal (`#7EC8B5`) accents against a dark green background to differentiate it from the W&M education card.

### Library Bookshelf

Books-per-shelf is dynamically computed based on viewport width:

```js
const booksPerShelf = isMobile
    ? Math.max(2, Math.floor((viewportWidth + gap) / (bookWidth + gap)))
    : 6;
```

Mobile shelves use `justify-content: space-evenly` with zero padding for full-bleed layout. Desktop uses `justify-content: center` with `2rem` padding. Book sizing uses `clamp()` for fluid scaling.

## Content Management

All text, lists, and links are in `src/data/content.json`. No React knowledge needed to update content.

### Update Homepage / Experience
Edit the `personal` or `experience` objects in `content.json`. The homepage bento grid renders items in JSON order.

### Update Interests
1. Add an object with a `title` to the `interests` array in `content.json`
2. Save the image to `public/images/{snake_case_title}.jpg` — the code converts titles to snake_case to find images
3. **Optional descriptions**: To add a description below an interest tag, add a `description` field to the image object in `src/pages/Interests.jsx`. Example: `{ src: "images/soccer.jpg", ..., description: "Arsenal fan since day one." }`

### Update the Library
1. Add `{ "title": "...", "author": "..." }` to the `books` array in `content.json`
2. **Optional cover**: Save as `public/images/covers/{snake_case_title}.jpg`. If no cover exists, a textured vintage spine is generated as fallback.
3. **Currently Reading**: Set `"currentlyReading": true` on a book to show a "Reading Now" badge in shelf view.

### Update Consulting Info
The Sycamore Creek card (homepage) and banner (resume) pull from `consulting` in `content.json` — fields: `name`, `tagline`, `url`.

### Update the /now Page
Edit the `now` object in `content.json` for text-only fields (`thinkingAbout`, `traveling`, `watching`, `playing`, `following`). The `nextFixture` object controls the Arsenal match pill (opponent, date, time, competition, home/away). Cards with embedded media (Music and Podcasts with Spotify embeds, Eating, Working On, Reading, Growing) have JSX in `src/pages/Now.jsx` — update the links, images, embed URLs, or header/tagline text directly in the component. Media images live in `public/images/now/`.

### Update MoodBoard Images
Images are hardcoded in `src/components/MoodBoard.jsx`. To swap an image, change the `src` attribute on the relevant `<img>` tag. Image files live in `public/images/`.

## Local Development

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/howeitis/personalsite.git
cd personalsite
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm test           # Vitest (53 tests across 10 files)
npm run build      # Production build
```

---

## Deployment

Auto-deploys via **Vercel** on every push to `main`.

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin main
```

No PR required — `main` pushes go straight to production at [howe.app](https://howe.app).

## Troubleshooting

### Arsenal Fixture Not Showing (API Key Issues)

The Arsenal next fixture pill on the `/now` page requires a valid `VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/).

**Symptoms**: Fixture pill is missing, blank, or shows fallback content.

**Known issue — `VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` is `undefined` in the production bundle.**

Confirmed via DevTools: no request to `api.football-data.org` is ever made. This means `import.meta.env.VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` is `undefined` at runtime, causing `useArsenalFixture.js:16` (`if (!apiKey) return`) to bail out silently and show the hardcoded fallback from `content.json`.

**Root cause**: Vite bakes `VITE_*` env vars into the JS bundle **at build time**, not runtime. The "Redeploy" button in Vercel **reuses the cached build** — it does NOT re-inject env vars. So updating the key in Vercel and clicking Redeploy has no effect if the same build artifact is reused.

**Checklist so far:**
1. ✅ Updated key in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables)
2. ✅ Triggered manual redeploy from Vercel Deployments tab
3. ✅ Confirmed no network request to `api.football-data.org` (DevTools → Network)
4. ❌ Key is still not present in bundle — root cause: cached build reused

**Fix — trigger a fresh build:**
- Push any commit to `main` (even an empty one: `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger rebuild"`) — this forces Vercel to run a new build that picks up the env var
- Or in Vercel: Settings → Environment Variables → delete and re-add `VITE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY`, then go to Deployments → select latest → Redeploy → **uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"**
- Confirm the env var is set for the **Production** environment (not just Preview/Development)

**To verify the key itself is valid before rebuilding:**
```bash
curl "https://api.football-data.org/v4/teams/57/matches?status=SCHEDULED&limit=1" \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: YOUR_KEY"
```

## Roadmap
